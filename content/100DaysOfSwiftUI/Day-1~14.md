### How to follow along

> We’ll be using a Swift Playground for all the code in this book. You can create one by launching Xcode, then going to the File menu and choosing New > Playground. When you’re asked what kind of playground to create, choose Blank from the macOS tab, then save it somewhere you can get to easily.

`File > New > Playground > Blank`

### How to create variables and constants

```swift
# variable
var greeting = "Hello, playground."

# constant
let name = "Foo"
```

> If you can, prefer to use constants rather than variables – not only does it give Swift the chance to optimize your code a little better, but it also allows Swift to make sure you never change a constant’s value by accident.

### Naming style

`Camel Case`: the second and subsequent words in a name start with a little bump for the capital letter:

```swift
let managerName = "Michael Scott"
let dogBreed = "Samoyed"
let meaningOfLife = "How many roads must a man walk down?"
```

### How to store decimal numbers

> When you’re working with decimal numbers such as 3.1, 5.56, or 3.141592654, you’re working with what Swift calls *floating-point* numbers. The name comes from the surprisingly complex way the numbers are stored by your computer: it tries to store very large numbers such as 123,456,789 in the same amount of space as very small numbers such as 0.0000000001, and the only way it can do that is by moving the decimal point around based on the size of the number.

`Type Safety`: once Swift has decided what data type a constant or variable holds, it must always hold that same data type.

### How to follow along

> We’ll be using a Swift Playground for all the code in this book. You can create one by launching Xcode, then going to the File menu and choosing New > Playground. When you’re asked what kind of playground to create, choose Blank from the macOS tab, then save it somewhere you can get to easily.

`File > New > Playground > Blank`

### How to create variables and constants

```swift
# variable
var greeting = "Hello, playground."

# constant
let name = "Foo"
```

> If you can, prefer to use constants rather than variables – not only does it give Swift the chance to optimize your code a little better, but it also allows Swift to make sure you never change a constant’s value by accident.

### Naming style

`Camel Case`: the second and subsequent words in a name start with a little bump for the capital letter:

```swift
let managerName = "Michael Scott"
let dogBreed = "Samoyed"
let meaningOfLife = "How many roads must a man walk down?"
```

### How to store decimal numbers

> When you’re working with decimal numbers such as 3.1, 5.56, or 3.141592654, you’re working with what Swift calls *floating-point* numbers. The name comes from the surprisingly complex way the numbers are stored by your computer: it tries to store very large numbers such as 123,456,789 in the same amount of space as very small numbers such as 0.0000000001, and the only way it can do that is by moving the decimal point around based on the size of the number.

`Type Safety`: once Swift has decided what data type a constant or variable holds, it must always hold that same data type. 

### How to store truth with Booleans

`Booleans.toggle()` the same as using `!` just in slightly less code, but it’s surprisingly useful when you’re dealing with complex code!

### How to join strings together

### Summary: Simple data

- Swift lets us create constants using `let`, and variables using `var`.
- If you don’t intend to change a value, make sure you use `let` so that Swift can help you avoid mistakes.
- Swift’s strings contain text, from short strings up to whole novels. They work great with emoji and any world language, and have helpful functionality such as `count` and `uppercased()`.
- You create strings by using double quotes at the start and end, but if you want your string to go over several lines you need to use three double quotes at the start and end.
- Swift calls its whole numbers *integers*, and they can be positive or negative. They also have helpful functionality, such as `isMultiple(of:)`.
- In Swift decimal numbers are called `Double`, short for double-length floating-point number. That means they can hold very large numbers if needed, but they also aren’t 100% accurate – you shouldn’t use them when 100% precision is required, such as when dealing with money.
- There are lots of built-in arithmetic operators, such as `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`, along with the special compound assignment operators such as `+=` that modify variables directly.
- You can represent a simple true or false state using a Boolean, which can be flipped using the `!` operator or by calling `toggle()`.
- String interpolation lets us place constants and variables into our strings in a streamlined, efficient way.

### Checkpoint_1

![image-20230403131819104](https://img.foopi.top/blog/image-20230403131819104.avif)

1. Use `let` to make your constant. You can call it whatever you want, but I think `celsius` would be an appropriate name.
2. Celsius is commonly stored as a decimal, so make sure and create it as one. This might mean adding “.0” to the end – using 25.0 rather than 25, for example.
3. We use `*` for multiplication and `/` for division.
4. Use `\(someVariable)` to activate string interpolation.
5. If you want to get fancy with `print()`, you can use Option+Shift+8 to get the degrees symbol: °. This means you can write something like 25°F.

### How to store ordered data in arrays

![image-20230403135752060](https://img.foopi.top/blog/image-20230403135752060.avif)

`.sorted()` returns a new array with its items sorted in ascending order, which means alphabetically for strings but numerically for numbers – the original array remains unchanged.

`.reversed()` I don't know how to use it properly at the moment.

### How to store and find data in dictionaries

### How to use sets for fast data lookup

![image-20230403151049622](https://img.foopi.top/blog/image-20230403151049622.avif)

Most of the time you’ll find yourself using arrays rather than sets, but sometimes – just sometimes – you’ll find that a set is exactly the right choice to solve a particular problem, and it will make otherwise slow code run in no time at all.

**Tip:** Alongside `contains()`, you’ll also find `count` to read the number of items in a set, and `sorted()` to return a sorted array containing the the set’s items.

### How to create and use enums

Remember that once you assign a value to a variable or constant, its data type becomes fixed – you can’t set a variable to a string at first, then an integer later on. Well, for enums this means you can skip the enum name after the first assignment, like this:

### How to use type annotations

![image-20230404103254574](https://img.foopi.top/blog/image-20230404103254574.avif)

### Summary: Complex data

- Arrays let us store lots of values in one place, then read them out using integer indices. Arrays must always be specialized so they contain one specific type, and they have helpful functionality such as `count`, `append()`, and `contains()`.
- Dictionaries also let us store lots of values in one place, but let us read them out using keys we specify. They must be specialized to have one specific type for key and another for the value, and have similar functionality to arrays, such as `contains()` and `count`.
- Sets are a *third* way of storing lots of values in one place, but we don’t get to choose the order in which they store those items. Sets are really efficient at finding whether they contain a specific item.
- Enums let us create our own simple types in Swift so that we can specify a range of acceptable values such as a list of actions the user can perform, the types of files we are able to write, or the types of notification to send to the user.
- Swift must always know the type of data inside a constant or variable, and mostly uses *type inference* to figure that out based on the data we assign. However, it’s also possible to use *type annotation* to force a particular type.

### Checkpoint_2

![image-20230404111607831](https://img.foopi.top/blog/image-20230404111607831.avif)

1. You should start by creating an array of strings, using something like `let albums = ["Red", "Fearless"]`
2. You can read the number of items in your array using `albums.count`.
3. `count` also exists for sets.
4. Sets can be made from arrays using `Set(someArray)`
5. Sets never include duplicates.

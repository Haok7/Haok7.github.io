#### How to follow along

> We’ll be using a Swift Playground for all the code in this book. You can create one by launching Xcode, then going to the File menu and choosing New > Playground. When you’re asked what kind of playground to create, choose Blank from the macOS tab, then save it somewhere you can get to easily.

`File > New > Playground > Blank`

#### How to create variables and constants

```swift
# variable
var greeting = "Hello, playground."

# constant
let name = "Foo"
```

> If you can, prefer to use constants rather than variables – not only does it give Swift the chance to optimize your code a little better, but it also allows Swift to make sure you never change a constant’s value by accident.

#### Naming style

`Camel Case`: the second and subsequent words in a name start with a little bump for the capital letter:

```swift
let managerName = "Michael Scott"
let dogBreed = "Samoyed"
let meaningOfLife = "How many roads must a man walk down?"
```

#### How to store decimal numbers

> When you’re working with decimal numbers such as 3.1, 5.56, or 3.141592654, you’re working with what Swift calls *floating-point* numbers. The name comes from the surprisingly complex way the numbers are stored by your computer: it tries to store very large numbers such as 123,456,789 in the same amount of space as very small numbers such as 0.0000000001, and the only way it can do that is by moving the decimal point around based on the size of the number.

`Type Safety`: once Swift has decided what data type a constant or variable holds, it must always hold that same data type. 

#### How to store truth with Booleans

![image-20230403114656566](https://img.foopi.top/blog/image-20230403114656566.avif)

`Booleans.toggle()` the same as using `!` just in slightly less code, but it’s surprisingly useful when you’re dealing with complex code!

#### How to join strings together

### Summary: Simple data

- Swift lets us create constants using `let`, and variables using `var`.
- If you don’t intend to change a value, make sure you use `let` so that Swift can help you avoid mistakes.
- Swift’s strings contain text, from short strings up to whole novels. They work great with emoji and any world language, and have helpful functionality such as `count` and `uppercased()`.
- You create strings by using double quotes at the start and end, but if you want your string to go over several lines you need to use three double quotes at the start and end.
- Swift calls its whole numbers *integers*, and they can be positive or negative. They also have helpful functionality, such as `isMultiple(of:)`.
- In Swift decimal numbers are called `Double`, short for double-length floating-point number. That means they can hold very large numbers if needed, but they also aren’t 100% accurate – you shouldn’t use them when 100% precision is required, such as when dealing with money.
- There are many built-in arithmetic operators, such as `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`, along with special compound assignment operators such as `+=` that modify variables directly.
- You can represent a simple true or false state using a Boolean, which can be flipped using the `!` operator or by calling `toggle()`.
- String interpolation lets us place constants and variables into our strings in a streamlined, efficient way.

### Checkpoint_1

![image-20230403131819104](https://img.foopi.top/blog/image-20230403131819104.avif)

1. Use `let` to make your constant. You can call it whatever you want, but I think `Celsius` would be an appropriate name.
2. Celsius is commonly stored as a decimal, so make sure and create it as one. This might mean adding “.0” to the end – using 25.0 rather than 25, for example.
3. We use `*` for multiplication and `/` for division.
4. Use `\(someVariable)` to activate string interpolation.
5. If you want to get fancy with `print()`, you can use Option+Shift+8 to get the degrees symbol: °. This means you can write something like 25°F.

#### How to store ordered data in arrays

![image-20230403135752060](https://img.foopi.top/blog/image-20230403135752060.avif)

`.sorted()` returns a new array with its items sorted in ascending order, which means alphabetically for strings but numerically for numbers – the original array remains unchanged.

`.reversed()` I don't know how to use it properly at the moment.

#### How to store and find data in dictionaries

![image-20230403143555443](https://img.foopi.top/blog/image-20230403143555443.avif)

#### How to use sets for fast data lookup

![image-20230403151049622](https://img.foopi.top/blog/image-20230403151049622.avif)

Most of the time you’ll find yourself using arrays rather than sets, but sometimes – just sometimes – you’ll find that a set is exactly the right choice to solve a particular problem, and it will make otherwise slow code run in no time at all.

**Tip:** Alongside `contains()`, you’ll also find `count` to read the number of items in a set, and `sorted()` to return a sorted array containing the set’s items.

#### How to create and use enums

Remember that once you assign a value to a variable or constant, its data type becomes fixed – you can’t set a variable to a string at first, and then an integer later on. Well, for enums this means you can skip the enum name after the first assignment, like this:

![image-20230403152135014](https://img.foopi.top/blog/image-20230403152135014.avif)

#### How to use type annotations

![image-20230404103254574](https://img.foopi.top/blog/image-20230404103254574.avif)

### Summary: Complex data

- Arrays let us store lots of values in one place, and then read them out using integer indices. Arrays must always be specialized so they contain one specific type, and they have helpful functionality such as `count`, `append()`, and `contains()`.
- Dictionaries also let us store lots of values in one place, but let us read them out using keys we specify. They must be specialised to have one specific type for the key and another for the value, and have similar functionality to arrays, such as `contains()` and `count`.
- Sets are a *third* way of storing lots of values in one place, but we don’t get to choose the order in which they store those items. Sets are really efficient at finding whether they contain a specific item.
- Enums let us create our own simple types in Swift so that we can specify a range of acceptable values such as a list of actions the user can perform, the types of files we are able to write, or the types of notification to send to the user.
- Swift must always know the type of data inside a constant or variable and mostly uses *type inference* to figure that out based on the data we assign. However, it’s also possible to use *type annotation* to force a particular type.

### Checkpoint_2

![image-20230404111607831](https://img.foopi.top/blog/image-20230404111607831.avif)

1. You should start by creating an array of strings, using something like `let albums = ["Red", "Fearless"]`
2. You can read the number of items in your array using `albums.count`.
3. `count` also exists for sets.
4. Sets can be made from arrays using `Set(someArray)`
5. Sets never include duplicates.

#### How to check whether a condition is true or false

![image-20230405140201083](https://img.foopi.top/blog/image-20230405140201083.avif)

![image-20230405140539033](https://img.foopi.top/blog/image-20230405140539033.avif)

#### How to check multiple conditions

![image-20230405145601136](https://img.foopi.top/blog/image-20230405145601136.avif)

![image-20230405151842071](https://img.foopi.top/blog/image-20230405151842071.avif)

#### How to use switch statements to check multiple conditions

![image-20230405155926518](https://img.foopi.top/blog/image-20230405155926518.avif)

- Swift requires that its `switch` statements are exhaustive, which means you must either have a `case` block for every possible value to check (e.g. all cases of an enum) or you must have a `default` case. This isn’t true for `if` and `else if`, so you might accidentally miss a case.
- When you use `switch` to check a value for multiple possible results, that value will only be read once, whereas if you use `if` it will be read multiple times. This becomes more important when you start using function calls because some of these can be slow.
- Swift’s `switch` cases allow for advanced pattern matching that is unwieldy with `if`.

#### How to use the ternary conditional operator for quick tests

If it helps, [Scott Michaud](https://twitter.com/scottmichaud/status/1087510756634083330) suggested a helpful mnemonic: **WTF**. It stands for “what, true, false”, and matches the order of our code:

- What is our condition? Well, it’s `age >= 18`.
- What to do when the condition is true? Send back “Yes”, so it can be stored in `canVote`.
- And if the condition is false? Send back “No”.

#### How to use a for loop to repeat work

![image-20230405173636927](https://img.foopi.top/blog/image-20230405173636927.avif)

Pronounce `1...5` as “one through five”, and `1..<5` as “one up to five,” and you’ll see similar wording elsewhere in Swift.

#### How to use a while loop to repeat work

![image-20230405175711335](https://img.foopi.top/blog/image-20230405175711335.avif)

- …the user asks us to stop

- …a server tells us to stop
- …we’ve found the answer we’re looking for
- …we’ve generated enough data

#### How to skip loop items with break and continue

Swift gives us two ways to skip one or more items in a loop: `continue` skips the current loop iteration, and `break` skips all remaining iterations.

### Summary: Conditions and loops

- We use `if` statements to check a condition is true. You can pass in any condition you want, but ultimately it must boil down to a Boolean.
- If you want, you can add an `else` block, and/or multiple `else if` blocks to check other conditions. Swift executes these in order.
- You can combine conditions using `||`, which means that the whole condition is true if either subcondition is true, or `&&`, which means the whole condition is true if both subconditions are true.
- If you’re repeating the same kinds of checks a lot, you can use a `switch` statement instead. These must always be exhaustive, which might mean adding a default case.
- If one of your `switch` cases uses `fallthrough`, it means Swift will execute the following case afterwards. This is not commonly used.
- The ternary conditional operator lets us check WTF: What, True, False. Although it’s a little hard to read at first, you’ll see this used a *lot* in SwiftUI.
- `for` loops let us loop over arrays, sets, dictionaries, and ranges. You can assign items to a loop variable and use it inside the loop, or you can use the underscore, `_`, to ignore the loop variable.
- `while` loops let us craft custom loops that will continue running until a condition becomes false.
- We can skip some or all loop items using `continue` or `break` respectively.

![image-20230815163100546](https://img.foopi.top/blog/image-20230815163100546.avif)

### Summary:  Functions

- Functions let us reuse code easily by carving off chunks of code and giving it a name.
- All functions start with the word `func`, followed by the function’s name. The function’s body is contained inside opening and closing braces.
- We can add parameters to make our functions more flexible – list them out one by one separated by commas: the name of the parameter, then a colon, then the type of the parameter.
- You can control how those parameter names are used externally, either by using a custom external parameter name or by using an underscore to disable the external name for that parameter.
- If you think there are certain parameter values you’ll use repeatedly, you can make them have a default value so your function takes less code to write and does the smart thing by default.
- Functions can return a value if you want, but if you want to return multiple pieces of data from a function you should use a *tuple*. These hold several named elements, but it’s *limited* in a way a dictionary is not – you list each element specifically, along with its type.
- Functions can throw errors: you create an enum defining the errors you want to happen, throw those errors inside the function as needed, and then use `do`, `try`, and `catch` to handle them at the call site.
